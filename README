SQLite3 bindings for Node.js
=============================

The code and some documentation live at http://code.google.com/p/node-sqlite/

The two files required to use these bindings are sqlite.js and
build/default/sqlite3_bindings.node. Put this directory in your
NODE_PATH or copy those two files where you need them.
