# NAME

node-sqlite3 - Asynchronous, non-blocking [SQLite3](http://sqlite.org/) bindings for [node.js](https://github.com/ry/node) 0.2.* and 0.4.*.



# USAGE

    var db = new sqlite3.Database(':memory:');
    db.serialize(function() {
      db.run("CREATE TABLE lorem (info TEXT)");

      var stmt = db.prepare("INSERT INTO lorem VALUES(?)");
      for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          stmt.run("Ipsum " + i);
      }

      db.each("SELECT rowid AS id, info FROM lorem", function(err, row) {
          console.log(row.id + ": " + row.info);
      });
    });



# API

## new sqlite3.Database(filename, [mode], [callback])

Returns a new Database object and automatically opens the database. There is no separate method to open the database.

* `filename`: Valid values are filenames, `":memory:"` for an anonymous in-memory database and and empty string for an anonymous disk-based database. Anonymous databases are not persisted and when closing the database handle, their contents are lost.

* `mode` *(optional)*: One or more of `sqlite3.OPEN_READONLY`, `sqlite3.OPEN_READWRITE` and `sqlite3.OPEN_CREATE`. The default value is `OPEN_READWRITE | OPEN_CREATE`.

* `callback` *(optional)*: If provided, this function will be called when the database was opened successfully or when an error occured. The first argument is an error object. When it is `null`, opening succeeded. If no callback is provided and an error occured, an `error` event with the error object as only parameter will be emitted on the database object. If opening succeeded, an `open` event with no parameters is emitted, regardless of whether a callback was provided or not.

## Database#run(sql, [param, ...], [callback])

Runs the SQL query with the specified parameters and calls the callback afterwards. It does not retrieve any result data. The function returns the Database object for which it was called to allow for function chaining.

* `sql`: The SQL query to run. If the SQL query is invalid and a callback was passed to the function, it is called with an error object containing the error message from SQLite. If no callback was passed and preparing fails, an `error` event will be emitted on the underlying Statement object.

* `param, ...` *(optional)*: When the SQL statement contains placeholders, you can pass them in here. They will be bound to the statement before it is executed. There are three ways of passing bind parameters: directly in the function's arguments, as an array and as an object for named parameters.

      // Directly in the function arguments.
      db.run("SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE id = ? AND name = ?", 2, "bar");

      // As an array.
      db.run("SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE id = ? AND name = ?", [ 2, "bar" ]);

      // As an object with named parameters.
      db.run("SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE id = $id AND name = $name", {
          $id: 2,
          $name: "bar"
      });

  Named parameters can be prefixed with `:name`, `@name` and `$name`. We recommend using `$name` since JavaScript allows using the dollar sign as a variable name without having to escape it. You can also specify a numeric index after a `?` placeholder. These correspond to the position in the array. Note that placeholder indexes start at 1 in SQLite. `node-sqlite3` maps arrays to start with one so that you don't have to specify an empty value as the first array element (with index 0). You can also use numeric object keys to bind values. Note that in this case, the first index is 1:

      db.run("SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE id = $id AND name = ?5", {
          1: 2,
          5: "bar"
      });

  This binds the first placeholder (`$id`) to `2` and the placeholder with index `5` to `"bar"`. While this is valid in SQLite and `node-sqlite3`, it is not recommended to mix different placeholder types.

* `callback` *(optional)*: If given, it will be called when an error occurs during any step of the statement preparation or execution, *and* after the query was run. If an error occured, the first (and only) parameter will be an error object containing the error message. If execution was successful, the first parameter is `null`. The context of the function (the `this` object inside the function) is the statement object. Note that it is not possible to run the statement again because it is automatically finalized after running for the first time. Any subsequent attempts to run the statement again will fail.

  If execution was successful, it contains two properties named `lastID` and `changes` which contain the value of the last inserted row ID and the number of rows affected by this query respectively. Note that `lastID` **only** contains valid information when the query was a successfully completed `INSERT` statement and `changes` **only** contains valid information when the query was a successfully completed `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement. In all other cases, the content of these properties is inaccurate and should not be used. The `.run()` function is the only query method that sets these two values; all other query methods such as `.all()` or `.get()` don't retrieve these values.



## Database#get(sql, [param, ...], [callback])

Runs the SQL query with the specified parameters and calls the callback with the first result row afterwards. The function returns the Database object to allow for function chaining. The parameters are the same as the `Database#run` function, with the following differences:

The signature of the callback is `function(err, row) {}`. If the result set is empty, the second parameter is `undefined`, otherwise it is an object containing the values for the first row. The property names correspond to the column names of the result set. It is impossible to access them by column index; the only supported way is by column name.



## Database#all(sql, [param, ...], [callback])

Runs the SQL query with the specified parameters and calls the callback with all result rows afterwards. The function returns the Database object to allow for function chaining. The parameters are the same as the `Database#run` function, with the following differences:

The signature of the callback is `function(err, rows) {}`. If the result set is empty, the second parameter is an empty array, otherwise it contains an object for each result row which in turn contains the values of that row, like the `Database#get` function.

Note that it first retrieves all result rows and stores them in memory. For queries that have potentially large result sets, use the `Database#each` function to retrieve all rows or `Database#prepare` followed by multiple `Statement#get` calls to retrieve a previously unknown amount of rows.



## Database#each(sql, [param, ...], [callback])

Runs the SQL query with the specified parameters and calls the callback with for each result row. The function returns the Database object to allow for function chaining. The parameters are the same as the `Database#run` function, with the following differences:

The signature of the callback is `function(err, row) {}`. If the result set succeeds but is empty, the callback is never called (this will change in the future). In all other cases, the callback is called once for every retrieved row. The order of calls correspond exactly to the order of rows in the result set.

If you know that a query only returns a very limited number of rows, it might be more convenient to use `Database#all` to retrieve all rows at once.

There is currently no way to abort execution.

# BUILDING

Make sure you have the sources for `sqlite3` installed. Mac OS X ships with these by default. If you don't have them installed, install the `-dev` package with your package manager, e.g. `apt-get install libsqlite3-dev` for Debian/Ubuntu.

To obtain and build the bindings:

    git clone git://github.com/developmentseed/node-sqlite3.git
    cd node-sqlite3
    ./configure
    make

You can also use [`npm`](https://github.com/isaacs/npm) to download and install them:

    npm install https://github.com/developmentseed/node-sqlite3/tarball/master



# TESTS

[expresso](https://github.com/visionmedia/expresso) is required to run unit tests.

    npm install expresso
    make test
